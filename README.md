# Flutter + ML

This is the repository for my Midterm Output for **CIT 209 - Integrative Programming**.

The application is a simple numerical digit detector, which attempts to predict a handwritten digit based off an image.

It makes use of the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to train a CNN model in predicting digits.

At its current state, the application has several limitations.

- The app can only predict one digit at a time.
- The digit must be clearly written with thick ink.
- The digit must be written in dark ink against a white or light colored background.
